# FashionMNIST Classification with PyTorch

## Project Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project that utilizes PyTorch to classify images from the FashionMNIST dataset. The project explores several neural network architectures to identify different clothing items from the dataset, which includes 10 different classes such as T-shirts/tops, Trousers, Pullovers, Dresses, Coats, Sandals, Shirts, Sneakers, Bags, and Ankle boots.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Automated downloading and loading of FashionMNIST using PyTorch's `torchvision` module.
- **Neural Network Implementations**:
  - Basic Neural Network with linear layers.
  - Advanced Neural Network with ReLU activation.
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for capturing spatial hierarchies in images.
- **Model Training and Validation**: Code to train and validate models using training and test datasets.
- **Performance Visualization**: Scripts to visualize training performance and test results including confusion matrices.
- **Utility Functions**: Includes helper functions for model evaluation and prediction.

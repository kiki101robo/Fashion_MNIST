# Fashion_MNIST

Project Overview
This project involves developing and training deep learning models to classify clothing images from the FashionMNIST dataset. It uses PyTorch, a popular machine learning library, to build and train several models, including simple neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to identify different types of clothing items.

Features
Data loading and preprocessing using PyTorch's torchvision datasets.
Implementation of different neural network architectures:
Basic Neural Network with linear layers.
Enhanced Neural Network with ReLU activation.
Convolutional Neural Network for more complex feature extraction.
Model training and evaluation to measure accuracy and loss metrics.
Visualization of training results and prediction outputs.
Custom utility functions to streamline the training and testing process.
Dataset
The FashionMNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each a 28x28 grayscale image associated with a label from 10 classes. The classes include items such as T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle boot.

Dependencies
Python 3.8+
PyTorch
Torchvision
Matplotlib
tqdm
requests (for downloading helper scripts)
NumPy
Ensure you have the latest version of these packages, as some functions used in the scripts depend on recent features provided by these libraries.

Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/fashion-mnist-classification.git
cd fashion-mnist-classification
Install Required Libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib tqdm requests
Run the Scripts: Navigate to the project directory and run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python fashion_mnist_classification.py
Explore the Models: After running the script, you can explore different models' performance in the generated output files or directly in your terminal.

Model Training and Evaluation
To train the models, the script processes images through various neural network architectures, calculating loss and accuracy at each epoch. It prints the performance metrics and visualizes them after training sessions. The final section of the script evaluates the models on the test dataset and visualizes confusion matrices and predictions.
